# Ninux-CA static website

This is an attempt to generate static website using cactus.

My playground for this expreriment will be a ninux.org website that IMO should be something like [this](http://www.autistici.org/en/ca/index.html) rather that [this](/dev/null)


## Installation
Install catcus using

```
# pip install git+https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus.git@v3
```
than ```cd``` inside the project and use ```cactus serve```

## Deploy
